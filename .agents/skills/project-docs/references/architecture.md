# Architecture Documentation Reference

## Purpose

Architecture documentation explains how the system is structured — the big picture that a new engineer needs before they touch code. Its job is to orient, not to exhaust. It answers: What components exist? How do they talk to each other? Why are they structured this way?

## File Placement Strategy

### Root `ARCHITECTURE.md`

- Lives at the repository root
- Describes the current state of the entire system — the big picture
- A new engineer reads this first before touching any code
- Answers: What components exist? How do they talk to each other? Why are they structured this way?
- Always reflects the current state, not aspirational/future state
- Must be updated whenever the system structure changes

### Per-module `ARCHITECTURE.md` (optional)

- Lives inside a module/package directory (e.g., `packages/auth/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `services/billing/ARCHITECTURE.md`)
- Describes that module's internal structure only — its layers, patterns, data flow, and key classes
- Only create one when a module is complex enough that its internal architecture is non-obvious from the code
- Must cross-reference the root ARCHITECTURE.md ("This module sits in the [Auth layer] of the root architecture")

### When to use which

| Situation                                    | File                                              |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| New project, single service                  | Root ARCHITECTURE.md only                         |
| Monorepo with multiple packages              | Root + one per complex package                    |
| Microservices                                | Root (showing service topology) + one per service |
| A module has >3 internal layers or >10 files | Consider a per-module ARCHITECTURE.md             |
| A module is a thin wrapper or CRUD           | Skip — root doc is sufficient                     |

### Cross-referencing

- Root doc should list all modules and link to their per-module architecture docs if they exist
- Per-module docs should link back to the root and reference their position in the system context
- Keep the root doc as the single source of truth for inter-module communication and system boundaries

## Standard: The C4 Model

The industry standard for software architecture documentation is the **C4 Model** (https://c4model.com/). It defines four zoom levels:

| Level | Name           | Audience   | Shows                                        |
| ----- | -------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | System Context | Everyone   | Your system + external actors/systems        |
| 2     | Container      | Technical  | Apps, databases, services inside your system |
| 3     | Component      | Developers | Internal structure of a single container     |
| 4     | Code           | Developers | Classes, functions, modules (rarely needed)  |

Start at Level 1. Add lower levels only where the complexity warrants it.

## When to choose this doc type

- New engineers need an orientation before reading code
- The system has multiple services, databases, or external integrations
- The team is planning a large change and needs a shared mental model
- No architecture doc exists and the codebase is non-trivial

## Clarifying questions to ask

1. What is the primary purpose of the system? (1–2 sentences)
2. Who are the users / external actors?
3. What are the main technical components? (services, databases, queues, CDN, third-party APIs)
4. How do these components communicate? (REST, gRPC, message queue, shared DB)
5. What infrastructure does it run on? (cloud provider, Kubernetes, serverless, etc.)
6. Which C4 levels do you need? (Context + Container is usually the right starting point)
7. Is a Mermaid diagram sufficient, or do you need draw.io / Structurizr output?

## Document Template

# Architecture — [System Name]

> **Last updated:** YYYY-MM-DD
> **Authors:** [names]
> **Status:** Draft / Current / Outdated

## Overview

[2–4 sentences describing what the system does, who uses it, and what problem it solves.]

---

## Level 1 — System Context

[Describe the system boundary and its external actors/dependencies.]

`mermaid
C4Context
Person(user, "End User", "Uses the system via web browser")
System(system, "Your System", "Does the core thing")
System_Ext(ext1, "Payment Provider", "Processes payments")
System_Ext(ext2, "Email Service", "Sends transactional emails")

Rel(user, system, "Uses", "HTTPS")
Rel(system, ext1, "Charges cards", "REST/HTTPS")
Rel(system, ext2, "Sends emails", "REST/HTTPS")
`

**External dependencies:**

| System           | Purpose            | Owner  | SLA    |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ------ | ------ |
| Payment Provider | Payment processing | Stripe | 99.99% |

---

## Level 2 — Containers

[Describe each deployable unit: web app, API server, worker, database, cache, etc.]

`mermaid
C4Container
Person(user, "User")
Container(webapp, "Web App", "React/Next.js", "Browser-based UI")
Container(api, "API Server", "Node.js/Express", "Business logic and data access")
ContainerDb(db, "Database", "PostgreSQL", "Stores all persistent data")
Container(worker, "Background Worker", "Node.js", "Async job processing")
Container(cache, "Cache", "Redis", "Session store and hot-path cache")

Rel(user, webapp, "Uses", "HTTPS")
Rel(webapp, api, "Calls", "REST/JSON")
Rel(api, db, "Reads/Writes", "SQL")
Rel(api, cache, "Reads/Writes", "Redis protocol")
Rel(api, worker, "Enqueues jobs", "BullMQ")
`

**Container inventory:**

| Container  | Technology           | Responsibility        | Scales                     |
| ---------- | -------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Web App    | React 18, Next.js 14 | UI rendering, routing | Horizontally               |
| API Server | Node.js 20, Express  | Business logic        | Horizontally               |
| Database   | PostgreSQL 15        | Persistent storage    | Vertically + read replicas |

---

## Level 3 — Components (optional, per container)

[Add one sub-section per container where internal structure matters.]

### API Server — Components

`mermaid
graph LR
  Router --> AuthMiddleware
  AuthMiddleware --> Controllers
  Controllers --> Services
  Services --> Repositories
  Repositories --> DB[(PostgreSQL)]
`

## Key Architectural Decisions

[Brief bullet list of the most important choices. For full reasoning, link to ADRs.]

- **Monorepo over poly-repo** — [link to ADR-001]
- **PostgreSQL over MongoDB** — chosen for strong relational consistency requirements
- **BullMQ for job queue** — Redis-backed, proven at scale, good DX

---

## Data Flow — Key Scenarios

[Show the flow for 2–3 important user journeys or operations.]

### User Authentication Flow

`Browser → POST /auth/login → Auth Service → validate credentials → issue JWT → Browser stores token`

---

## Infrastructure

| Environment | Platform       | Region    | Notes                |
| ----------- | -------------- | --------- | -------------------- |
| Production  | AWS ECS + RDS  | us-east-1 | Auto-scaling enabled |
| Staging     | AWS ECS + RDS  | us-east-1 | Single replica       |
| Local dev   | Docker Compose | local     | Uses seed data       |

---

## Non-Functional Characteristics

| Property             | Target  | Current               |
| -------------------- | ------- | --------------------- |
| Availability         | 99.9%   | 99.95% (last 90 days) |
| P99 API latency      | < 500ms | 320ms                 |
| Max concurrent users | 10,000  | untested above 3,000  |
