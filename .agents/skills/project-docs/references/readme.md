# README Reference

## Purpose

The README is the front door of a repository. It is read by strangers who found the repo on GitHub, new team members getting oriented, and potential contributors evaluating whether to use or contribute to the project. It must answer in under 90 seconds: "What is this? Can I use it? How do I get started?"

A README is NOT exhaustive documentation. It is an orientation and a pointer to deeper resources.

## When to choose this doc type

- New repository needs a README
- Existing README is outdated, thin, or confusing
- User wants to open-source a project and needs a professional README
- Project README doesn't match the current state of the codebase

## Clarifying questions to ask

1. What does this project do? (1 sentence — the elevator pitch)
2. Who is the audience? (other developers, end users, internal team only, public open source)
3. What is the primary language/tech stack?
4. Is there a hosted demo or docs site?
5. What are the install and run steps? (dependency manager, env vars, commands)
6. Does it have tests? How do you run them?
7. Is there a contributing guide or code of conduct?
8. What license is it under?
9. What tone? (professional enterprise, friendly open source, terse internal tool)

## Variant: Internal Tool README

For internal tooling (not open source), simplify the template:

- Remove badges and license
- Add: "Owner: [team/person]", "Slack: #channel-name"
- Add: "Support: [who to contact when it breaks]"
- Focus on: What it does, how to run it, known gotchas
